### Hi there 👋

I’m Alok, currently working as a Solution Architect, with extensive experience as a full-stack lead and DevOps engineer. I’m a skilled coder and an enthusiastic designer passionate about full-stack development. I specialize in architecting scalable solutions, transforming user-centric designs into pixel-perfect websites, and building high-performance server applications. My philosophy: "Making mistakes is better than faking perfection." 🙂

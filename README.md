## Hi, I’m Alok

I am a **Solution Architect** with deep, hands-on experience across **full-stack engineering, cloud architecture, DevOps, and system design**. Over the years, I have evolved from an individual contributor into a technical leader who architects, builds, reviews, and scales production-grade systems.

My work sits at the intersection of **business requirements and engineering execution**—translating complex problems into pragmatic, scalable, and cost-efficient solutions. I believe strong architecture is not about complexity, but about **clarity, resilience, and long-term maintainability**.

---

### What I Do

* Architect and deliver **end-to-end systems** spanning frontend, backend, infrastructure, and integrations
* Design **scalable cloud-native solutions** with a strong focus on reliability, cost optimization, and security
* Lead technical discussions, system design reviews, estimations, and architectural decision-making
* Mentor engineers and collaborate closely with product, UX, and business stakeholders

---

### Professional Focus Areas

* **Architecture & System Design**: Modular, scalable, and domain-driven architectures
* **Cloud & DevOps**: Azure, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, infrastructure optimization
* **Backend Engineering**: .NET, Node.js, distributed systems, background workers, integrations
* **Frontend Engineering**: React.js, performance-focused UI engineering, design-to-code execution
* **Databases & Data Modeling**: RDBMS, graph databases, migration strategies, data integrity
* **Cost & Performance Optimization**: Practical trade-offs over theoretical best practices

---

### Experience Highlights

* Solution Architect at **Byteridge Software Private Limited**, driving architecture and delivery across multiple large-scale client engagements
* Hands-on contributor to **Microsoft platforms**, including Bing and the Microsoft Admin Portal
* Led and contributed to complex systems involving third-party integrations, data migrations, and phased rollouts
* Active contributor to architectural decisions around **Docker vs Kubernetes**, self-hosted vs managed services, and cloud cost governance

---

### Certifications & Credentials

*  **AWS Partner Certification** – Cloud solution alignment, partner-led architecture, and AWS best practices
* **Neo4j Professional Certified** – Graph data modeling and query expertise
* **ZEDEDA Certified Edge Computing Associate**
* Strong working knowledge of **Azure services**, deployments, and operational management

---

### Current Interests

* Cloud architecture patterns and platform engineering
* Kubernetes and container orchestration trade-offs
* Graph-based problem solving and real-world Neo4j use cases
* Designing systems that balance **engineering excellence with business reality**

---

### Philosophy

> *“Making mistakes is better than faking perfection.”*

I value transparency, thoughtful experimentation, and learning through execution. Real systems improve through iteration—not theory alone.

---

### Writing & Knowledge Sharing

I occasionally write about engineering, architecture, and real-world problem solving.
